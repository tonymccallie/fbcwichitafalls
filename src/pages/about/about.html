		<p>People who attend our church come from different experiences and backgrounds.&nbsp; One thing you will quickly notice about the First family is that we're not your stereotypical Baptist church. We are unique. We believe church should be fun and exciting, yet without compromising the truth of God’s Word, the Bible.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			We are a Christian evangelical church—a church whose primary purpose is to share the good news of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			We call our church a Church in 3D because we concentrate on three areas of church life.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Decisions</b> - We want to see people make life and eternity changing decisions for Christ by accepting Him as their Savior.&nbsp; To that end you will find both our staff and members ready to share how to become a Christian.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Development</b> - Once a person has accepted Christ we want to help them grow as a Christian through a variety of opportunities including LIFE Groups, Family Night at First, Special Bible Studies for various interests and more.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Deployment</b> - We believe that a Christian, and the church, should help others so we want to help everyone find a place of service where they may use their skills, talents and abilities to help others come to know Christ and grow in their faith.<br>
			<br>
			Ultimately the purpose of the church is to lead people to become obedient and reproducing disciples of Jesus Christ, as He commanded in Matthew 28:18-20.&nbsp;<br></p>
